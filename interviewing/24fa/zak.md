Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - lee, farmer and I

  - farmer:
    - having recitations were really nice and important
    - a very nice point where the TAs can connect with students in a more collaborative environment. Did go to recitation
    - want to be involved with this

  - as it stands, really like the course topics and assignments

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - thank them for coming to him with the concerns
 - narrow down why it is that way
 - it takes time and if you have the time you can do it
 - these are hard things
 - by coming here you are setting yourself up for success
 - these feelings are normal

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - main thing he wants to be part of is recitation
  - review sessions as well, when those come up
