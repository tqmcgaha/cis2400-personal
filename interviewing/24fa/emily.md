23fa 2400 TA
24sp 3800 TA

took it with me in 22fa


Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level

  - a lot of students didn't really like that we did LC4
  - 5710 is now in riscv

  - 23fa did not have public autograders, probably make them public

  - more time on C instead of ASM.
    - learning more about C is more helpful then assembly
    - still useful ot have gates and asm

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?


- How was being a 3800 TA? Any particular positives or negatives? Anything that you think could be improved about the TA experience?
  - free food was a nice bonys
  - weekly meetings was nice to see what everyone was up to
  - made a few friends
  - social TA may help still
    - intro courses do that
  - like office hours, a few came weekly and got a chance to meet them
  - a lot less students in 3800 than expected
  - really liked your pennos group

  - TAs be in more specific roles
    - in 2400, was part of the Ed committee
      - part of friday and saturday 
    - some people were on the autograder comittee
    - especially with making sure things get answered on Ed
      - maybe have specific days
  
  -  

- One thing that I am planning to change is how TAs are organized. Any thoughts on what I list below? Please be honest about what you think. This may include:
  - Head TAs
  - Trying to build a better "community" among course staff
    - maybe a social TA?
    - May try to have higher expectations on staff meetings
    - May try to have TAs get more involved (recitations, HW dev, Ed committees, etc).


- Is there anything in particular you hope to experience or "get" from TA-ing for CIS 2400?
  - pretty close to the work she does in other things
    - does a lot of C programming
  - being able to teach others is hopefully helping thme
  - likes helping and building connections
    - made friends with 2 or 3 students she had

- Are there any initiatives you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024? (below are some tentative things. This is not a complete list, I am happy to hear about anything you would be interested in doing!)
  - Lecture Hours
  - Recitations
  - Assignment / Autograder Development
  - Exam Writing
  - Anything you can come up with!

  - not 100% sure
    - lecture TA sounds pretty cool
    - recitation would be cool
    - maybe wellness, like reaching out to students
    - depending on how much assignments change, maybe that
