doing accelerated masters in CIS
took 2400 with lee

Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  
  - CIS 2400 is a big and fundamental course and brings a lot of 2400 students together
    - great opporunity to bring people together and have people make friends
    - is a CIS 3500 TA, eric does it :)
    - if 70% of students got bobba together and proved it, then +1 point to course
    - 70 students tho
  - mentorship in class opportunity
  - maybe instead of bobba, do like a puzzle hunt or discusion on semi conductor
  - there was an activity for introducing each other
  - rewards can be something other than notes, like bonus problem sets or something

  - keep the same:
    - liked the hw structure
      - going from beginning to end from alu -> snake & timer w/ fruit and bombs
      - inspired him to take CIS 5710
      - TA's were really helpful and had review sessions before each test
        - also before hard topics
      - had recitations every week that were recorded
   
  - one thing that people like from 2400
     - caches
     - the three C's
       - conflicts
     - talked about tag bits, index bits, set associative


- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - Understand the studen'ts learning habbits first, does he come to lectures consistently, does he utilize the resources
 - have they done all he could
 - mentioned how he is using "he" pronouns but could use other pronouns
 - teach fundmanetl knowledge to hlep him build his own knowledge block



- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - he is currently co-head TA for cis 3500 project
  - wants to know the vision for the TA staff team
  - see what the other TAs are, and see if you can match with one of the envisoins

  - class engagement & TA engagement
    - engage TAs for them to consistently show up to grading and do things before deadline
    - hoodies, merches, food events, etc

  - not sure about hosting review sessions
    - need a big team to do this, could not do himself

  - could envision doing the class challenges

Other Notes:
