5050 is rough
only three classes in fall
not sure how on campus he will be
office hours online


Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level

  - realized what you did in ESE 3700
    - built an SRAM in memory

  - having more C knowledge would be really helpful for 3800 and future course
    - every course that comes after 2400 assumes you have knowledge for C and C++ would be useful
  - some of the homeworks (like decoder and simulator) is a bunch of if/else
    - kinda like java

  - not gone over much
    - debugging in C
    - segfaults
    - use gdb
  
  - some circuit stuff is still good
    - most students are CIS, so having some appretiation still good
  
  - felt like the transitions from not programming to asm & C was quick


- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?

- How was being a 3800 TA? Any particular positives or negatives? Anything that you think could be improved about the TA experience?

- One thing that I am planning to change is how TAs are organized. Any thoughts on what I list below? Please be honest about what you think. This may include:
  - Head TAs
  - Trying to build a better "community" among course staff
    - maybe a social TA?
    - May try to have higher expectations on staff meetings
    - May try to have TAs get more involved (recitations, HW dev, Ed committees, etc).

- ed committee
  - 5710 ed posts are never answered
    - 2 day ssometimes
  - 5050 really well organized
    - linh is a bit crazy
    - answers every ed post in extreme detail within 30 minutes
  - 5050 is harder, but felt like a better course due to how organized and responsive things are
    - 5050 has also been running the same way for many semesters

- make sure TAs are good people

- Is there anything in particular you hope to experience or "get" from TA-ing for CIS 2400?
  - last time he TA'd it, enjoyed it a lot
  - recitations would be fun and interesting
  - improving his knowledge on C and stuff more
    - every time he teaches, he learns more

- Are there any initiatives you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024? (below are some tentative things. This is not a complete list, I am happy to hear about anything you would be interested in doing!)
  - Lecture Hours
  - Recitations
  - Assignment / Autograder Development
  - Exam Writing
  - Anything you can come up with!
