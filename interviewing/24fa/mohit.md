Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - feels like the course on itself is very powerful as an introcourse
  - great intro course to intro people from lc4 to C
  - monthly review sesison to go over what happened in the last month. It is really a lot, and this may help

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - these things happen, hes had moements where its a lot
 - talk and interact with other students. Doing that may help with reinforcing material and getting over misonceptoins
 - may prepare them for things in the long run

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - being part of recitations. 
    - there is a vibe between the mentors teaching recitaiton and the kuds they are trying to help
    - some kids have clever alternative to things that the TA hasn't handled or thought of before, in a way can be a teaching expereince
    - likes seeing the growth of that student from beginning to end
