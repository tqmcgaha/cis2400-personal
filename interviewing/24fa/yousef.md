Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - changing from VM to docker
  - docker may not work for pennsim  due to lack of gui :(
  - 4710 moved to risc-v and that is more modern and real

  - add more hands on approach to GDB and valgrind
  - they have fault code and need to run it
    - lots of people did not have expereince with gdb in 3800, gdb helped

  - liked the flexibility of the assignments
    liked having the deadlines but not being end of world if you miss it

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - ask when they started feeling this (from beginning or more recent)
 - if it is from beginning of semester, it may be a deeper issues
 - more recent may be due to midterm or mid semester stress
