Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?

- How was being a 3800 TA? Any particular positives or negatives? Anything that you think could be improved about the TA experience?

- One thing that I am planning to change is how TAs are organized. Any thoughts on what I list below? Please be honest about what you think. This may include:
  - Head TAs
  - Trying to build a better "community" among course staff
    - maybe a social TA?
    - May try to have higher expectations on staff meetings
    - May try to have TAs get more involved (recitations, HW dev, Ed committees, etc).

- Is there anything in particular you hope to experience or "get" from TA-ing for CIS 2400?

- Are there any initiatives you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024? (below are some tentative things. This is not a complete list, I am happy to hear about anything you would be interested in doing!)
