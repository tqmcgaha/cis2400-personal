Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - more preparation for end of course, especially with C practice
  - farmer over summer, retook it with lee in fall
    - summer pace was too much
  - farmer spent more time on cmos
  - lee spent more time on caches
  
  - maybe not just implementing data structures, but also how you manage them with pointers and malloc
    - malloc was not prepared for fall

  - good to include transistors and cmos
    - not much need to go into it
    - how do you go from nmos and pmos to gates, and then go from gate level
    - avoid:
      - oh why does the cmos behave this way?
      - if you are interested, take ese 3700
      - don't spent a lot of time on it
      - replace the cmos stuff with caching or more c practice
      - caches was nice since you took it for 4710
        - how you create offsets and what levels of caching are are good
        - going into things like set associativity, tag bits, etc may be too much

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - first thing is "no type of person to quote un quote get it"
 - so many tpyes of people and learning, it may not work best for you but you can do it
 - if it is halfway throug the semester, see "is that raelly true"? You probably know w hat a bit is
   - can go into more depth
 - he withrdrew the first time, part of it is how material is presented
 - part of it is how you approach the class

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - definitely want to help be in recitation teaching or planning
  - recitations for him was really helpful especially to have a student condense and explain materials to students from a student perspective
    - review sesssions too
  - want to hepl with these homeworks for preparing C and data structures
    - could help with developing these, and could help some
    - maybe code-along things in recitations
      - work on it with partner
      - come back, we are here to help if you get stuck

Debugging:
- 



Reflection:
- 



Other Notes:
- question on how recitaions are organized
- why LC4?
- our intro systems course is a lot less complex?
  - other schools do a real thing
