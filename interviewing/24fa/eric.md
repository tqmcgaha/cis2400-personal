2nd year in 3800 rn

Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - emphasis on stack heap and memory allocation was really useful
  - learning the memory was really helpful for visualizing the course and 3800
  
  - instead of spedning a unit or 2 on C debugging, would rather shift it into caching and more conceptual stuff
  - debugging and low level stuff on hardware circuits.
    - think it is good to not talk about caching, it is helpful for stuednts
    - focus on conceptual knowledge is more satisfying and can be learned on their own

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - encountered this before in one of his programming clubs
 - encourage them to practice more
 - everything to them is so new and takes time to digest
 - it is very different to other CIS classes, and the introduction to how HW/SW interact with each other
 - encourage them to solidify their foundational knowledge
 - willing to meet with them on the side (especially if they are struggling a lot)
 - being able to reach out to Jerry on the side was very helpful in 3800


- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - have sessions on the side for intro to C (on the side, not in lecture)
  - lecture should be more conceptual
  - would want to lead this session
  - 2400 didn't have many opportunities to share work with othres
    - liked the penn-shell code reviews
    - early exposure to this kind of stuff could be very useful

Other Notes:
