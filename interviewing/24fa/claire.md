Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - sequence of content was nice, going from bits - > transistors - > logic gates -> c
  - each biuld up made you feel you had the context to learn things and when programming in C could look back onto past material

  - changes
    - really easy to mistake how globals, the stack, the heap etc are stored
    - some sort of check-ins are useful to make sure you are following



- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - relates to this, had it in her schedule in fall but dropped since other people seemed confident and she wasn't
   - was too scared to go to OH
 - "Ok, this is a hard course for me", went to OH a]nd it turend out to eb seruper useflu
 - really important to listen about why they feel that way
