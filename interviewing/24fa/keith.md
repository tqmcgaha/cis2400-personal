Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?

  - HW deadlines

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
  - start by saying, there is no rubric for "getting it".
    seeking out support is "getting it" that you try it and are trying to learn
    it is easy to get bogged down in the assignment and stuff, but wider context is important. If you get the big idea, you've already learned. Everything else is finder fetails and discusisons on that.
    "getting it" is a broad term, but even I don't "get it"
  - sometimes you don't trust yourself, but 


- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
