Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - Big component of trying to understand C and assembly was hard. Would have helped if there was mini practices with writing C code
    - a big jump between RPN and dissassembler
      - probably because for RPN you could almost treat it as java or similar to other assignments
      - dissassembler gets kinda low level and feels more like "C"
    - having exerceise may have helped with this

    - really liked how many examples there were on the course website
    - slides were nice and walked through the whole evolution of the stack, it didn't jump from one slide to the next
      > the thing I do where I "animate" slides

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - first probably try and tell them it isn't an issue of a binary thing from "not" to "getting it"
    - sometimes it just "clicks" though
 - he didn't start with stellar grades, but you get better with time
 - going to office hours is a good start
 - would want to help jump into questions about whatever project you are working on at the moment

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  - 

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - didn't come in thinking of any, so take some from me >:]
  - would enjoy teaching recitations prolly
    - like that format
    - be a good opportunity to get better at public speaking and speaking in general
  - be part of the Ed committee
