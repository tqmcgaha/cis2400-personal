Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - more control over the files themselves
  - for Lee and farmer, the header files and makefiles are read only, cannot be modified
  - less assignments, for farmer he has 10. Ben Lee did it in 5 assignments
  - propose moving from codio to docker and github. This is what we did in 3800
    - pretty hard to grade in codio because it is made read only when they submit
    - no autograders

  - really liked the disassembler
    - understand the different parts of memory is really important
  - keep rpn calculator
    - using the deque is really important for 3800


- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - empathetic and make sure the student feels emotionally safe
 - then goes into the technical stuff. Usually this comes from being overwhelemed in the course
 - a makefile (and looking at the structure of the code really helps the student break down the assignment into smaller chnuks)
 - in office hours: more important to architect the code so that they aren't lost. 
 - if they are lost, it is probably because they don't understand the architecture

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - emphasis on linux commands
    - people don't know what rm does
    - a session with the shell or something
    - if they get these commands, they can write their own makefile 
  - recitations really helpful
    - could help re-emphasize
    - posting some of these slides from my version of the course

- liked lee's course organizaiton
  - ed committee
  - hw comittee
    - professor lee said to reduce to 5 to limit the overwhelm
  - grading in person

- farmer:
  - everyone chooses a day they are on Ed
  - everyone does grading
  - meeting and grading is async
    - not good for morale

- no recitations for either

Debugging:
- Did not say the "no worries, we do not intend to find all the bugs, it is about seeing you interact with the students"
