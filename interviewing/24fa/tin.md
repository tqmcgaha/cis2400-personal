Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - change LC4 to x86 or risc-v since the stack conventions changes between LC4 and x86.

  - liked recitatoins

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - Weird question to ask in OH
 - not sure how to respond to it to be honest
 - if I suggest to go back to slides, they already have the power to do that
 - Change their mentality
   - empathise with them. The course was difficult for him too
   - I know it is ok to not get it first time around
   - wish for the best it works out the second 

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - Recitations are a good addition
    - would like to host some of them or lead would be nice
    - not sure how exactly it works
    - would like to be the "host" for one of them or lead the group
    - review was really useful and all that was done for 3800, thought it was heplful
