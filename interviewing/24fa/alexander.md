last semseter lee

used malloc once in snake
maybe used it once, if even that
not a lot of expereince

Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  
  - from lee
    - wasn't super comfortable with a lot of C programming
    - linked list in C on the **exam**
      - pretty flexible with grading it
    - having more exposure to C would help
      - did snake.c and the assembler & simulator
      - some of those famous C problems. linked list, data structures, two-sum (common leetcode for example of hashing, just an example of a probelm most people have probably seen) 
      - want to make sure they are confident in C helps

    - written homeworks were formatter kinda badly
      - translate binary to hex
      - a lot of people did a calculator
      - some were a canvas and easy to calculate

      - instead of simple translation, an assignment more on what you want to know, a deeper understanding than trnslation
        - maybe something where you need to understand the binary
        - like reading the hexdump of memory into what it actually means to understand it
        - more grounded
        - Disassembler hw
     
     - liked the 22fa, homeworks were 64%, in lee they were only 40%
       - my hws were more organized
       - exams can't test on a lot of what you learned
       - had 3 "midterms"

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - First step, get the context
 - if this is the first thing of a new topic and people are stuck and it is an outburst
   - can go back to previous concepts, they made it this far, where did your understand go wrong
   - we can review the stuff
 - if someone didn't understand anytihn the whole course
   - that is not true, you made it this far you probably remember this
   - you are probably just missing one connection
     - find the missing connection and make it

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - one thing that he was bringin up was the connections
    - some of these things can be hard to understand why they are necessary
    - obviously there are office hours and recitations, but maybe sessions or recitations that are not just review
      but also the "so what?" to tie the connection to why this is important
    - or even binary to assembly connection
    - even if attendence is not good, the video could be useful
    - a video that would be useful in our context and our courses
    - could be hard to get access to somethings without this

Debugging:
- asked some beginning diagnostics
- aksed me to copmile and run
- oof segmentation fault
- very hands on with the laptop and typed a lot
- fixed the malloc and str++ bug
- talked through his thought process a lot with a few questions askgin "does this try to do blah" and I would usually just go "yes"
