perry (Perrie)
MCIT first year

2400 and 5930
- liked the material

Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  -  

  - 5930
    - more review sessions in lecutre
    - it covers a lot, lots are kinda different
    - moving so rapidly made quite a few people feel very lost
    - 5930 recitations
      - were mostly lectures, would be better for it to be more active

  - 5950
    - having more check-in quizzes
      - humbles you

  - lean towards with 2400, 5930 recitation clashes with schedule

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - valid feelings, normal to feel this way. couse is challenging
 - fine

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - open to holding more review sessions near exams
  - autograding
  - ed (quite ok with that, would have been really helpful)

- wouldn't say she wants to be a teacher, but is exploring for the sake of it
  - teaching is a good way to pay back and also take stock of youro wn understanding

Debugging:
- started good with "what have you tried, any idea where it is?" 



Reflection:
- 



Other Notes:
