Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level

  - primary things are the assignments
    - some assignments are obtuse and don't lead to solid progression
    - LC4 ones are really long and you don't have much time to understand what you are doing
    - each assignment is ~1 week except simulator is ~2 weeks
    - currently ~20 hours a week

    - may be due to only feedback is the grades, and these are manually grading
    - especially since there is so much course content, when you miss small understanding checks, it helps
      - maybe small exercises or small group exercises
    
    - fall 22
      - autograders and exercisses give immediate feedback
      - assignments made more sense in a way
    
    - these are not that open ended, youhave a target you need to reach
      - needs to be more specific if we have specific requirements

  - slightly biased towards C programming, could have more role outside of the assembler target
    - maybe a littl bit of C++ (smart pointers)

  - like the concepts past the transistors
    - transistors don't show up again
  

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?

  - sense of empathy
  - I'm head TA now, but I've been throguh it now
  - most people feel this at some point
  - we have resources to help
  - even getting this far has given you exposure, and you are probably not that far ooff
    - there are resources for you

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?

- How was being a 2400 TA? Any particular positives or negatives? Anything that you think could be improved about the TA experience?
  - really liked it, teacihng is a great way to learn things and master a subject
  - ability to help others learning and mastering the content

  - currently a lot of TA's do not do the work they are assigned
    - something more rigid to incentivize doing the work they do
    - ~half of the TA's 

  - was able to build some community, for those that also got engaged
    - maybe group style things in lecture or recitations may help build community between 

- One thing that I am planning to change is how TAs are organized. Any thoughts on what I list below? Please be honest about what you think. This may include:
  - Head TAs
  - Trying to build a better "community" among course staff
    - maybe a social TA?
    - May try to have higher expectations on staff meetings
    - May try to have TAs get more involved (recitations, HW dev, Ed committees, etc).

  - don't really want someone grading more than ~10 people a week

  - Head TA:
  - make grading assignments, handle student logistical issues (wellness, personal issue), creating rubrics and grading docs
    - adjusting assignments if there is somethinre really not working
    - organization for review sessions and recitations

- Is there anything in particular you hope to experience or "get" from TA-ing for CIS 2400?
  - Feel like the most rewarding part is the teaching and feeling that you are contributing towards learning
  - much more interested in homeworks and recitations
    - is fall guy for grading and doesn't do office hours this semester

- Are there any initiatives you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024? (below are some tentative things. This is not a complete list, I am happy to hear about anything you would be interested in doing!)
  - Lecture Hours
  - Recitations
  - Assignment / Autograder Development
  - Exam Writing
  - Anything you can come up with!

  - student lead to make new assignments
  - hold different group learning style things outside of the course
    - Recitation?
    - Review Session?
    - maybe doing it in lecture?

- how is the rleationship with tas you manage
  - it is a bit weird, but it is your job
  - hard to tow the line
  - need to ask if someone can do somehting or it should be given to someone else

- adopting changes 
  - they will be a bit adverse to changing the topic
     - especially since he has the pre-recorded videos
  - has interest in changing the assignments
    - may be too much work to change the assignments especially change the course to acommodate for it
  - if there is something like moving to codio or git
   - could move to it but worried about it getting setup in time.
   - would be interested if it seems to be going well
  - he is happy when students are happy
    - reciatoin style and gropu learning style things
    - if they seem to work and don't seem to hard to put together, he is probably inclined
