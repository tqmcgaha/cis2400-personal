Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - likes the topics, think taught well
  - maybe change organization
    - having a more clear division on what is what section of slides and what is next topic can help
  - really dislike codio, lots of issues with it
    - especially without in-person OH that couldn't help with these issues.
    - ran his code locally
    - sometimes freezes
    - sometimes doesn't save work
    - launch jar didn't really work half the time

  - some sort of individualized support like recitations would be nice

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - maybe they are not the right fit for the class, don't want to push yourself through if you really don't like the course or don't want to do it
 - 
 - probably could also try and diagnose which parts they are feeling best/worst with
   - sometimes it is easy to think of thsi course as a jumbled mess
     - there are still topics, some of which you know
   - probably send them off to professor and have them talk about it worst case

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - recitations
  - some kind of support for recitaitons
  - maybe some kind of content office hours separate from the debugging/homework office hours
  - look into alternatives to codio
