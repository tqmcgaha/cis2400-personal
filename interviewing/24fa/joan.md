Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - put some thought into it
  - referred back to 3800, really liked that course
    - favourite CIS course, made the course engaging
    - slow the pace down for 2400, make the pace consistent
    - first half is so slow, basically drawing shapes for two weeks
    - then doing assemly and C and it gets a bit fast paced
      - do what I did in class where we demoed the projects in class and help give an approach to it
      - helpful with the OS open ended
    - a bootcamp or something to help them with C

  - could probably ease them into C even earlier. The ASM was harder than the C. The c is easier to test than assembly, so maybe do C first

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - reassure them that it is not the case of "Getting it" but that you try different approaches and put time into it. You can' brute force it, but maybe you can try a different approach
   - maybe do OH in hw or go to OH after
   - being able to talk with others helps a lot
   - weingarten
   - reassure them that they are capable of getting it, you just need to be assured and it is up to the effort and level of want to learn the material

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - THe C introductory thing, would have been very helpful to him
  - the C introduction he got was not very deep
    - some extra view on data types and pointers
  - ed committee
    - this semester really lacked pepole dedicated to clearing Ed
    - lots of posts are left on read
  - with lee, he would designated to check on some days
    - made the ed posts much more manageable
    - took it step by step
