Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - really like th electures and videos and slides

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - trace back to what you do understand
 - go from where they understand and trace back to where their understanding breaks
 - maybe they have the foundation but felel through at some point
 
 - maybe you look into it and you do bridge that gap
 - go through what they understand and don't
 - give some techniques for waht you do
 - some simple practice things may be good
