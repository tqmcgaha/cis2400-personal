Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - took it a whlie aog
  - the large projects with a lot of C and assembly
  - really made you learn C and assembly
  - projects in OS also are good for getting you to learn things

  - course load was a bit high and ramps up as it goes on
  - could be moved to make it more balanced
  - maybe have some simpler coding projects
  - they had some simpler assigments with timing diagrams and gates
    - introducing some of the projects early may be helpful

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - take out a whiteboard and show them what they do know, they probably have what it takes. These are the things you've already learned and mastered
 - it may be the new content, the TA's are here to help and support you. It may take more time but we canwork around it etc.

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - ed was one of maya's most useful things with hepling students
  - liked cleaning up the spec and making sure everything is correct
