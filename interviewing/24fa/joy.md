!!!career in teaching
- did a lot of tutoring and teaching previously
  - just really enjoy teaching
  - really appreciate seeing teaching from a different lens than intro


Joy, sophmore

generally enjoyed cis 2400 (summer 23)

TA'd most semesters, want to do systems
- really liked the 1210 community and doing intro
  - TAing algorithms for infinite semesters may not be that useful and may also get boring
  - Intro courses are different
    rajiv is notoriously difficult and seeing demotivated students
  - not doing mini courses

Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - majority of stuff from the course, can't change a lot of the scope or content

  - would change the structure
    - course is taught on codio, usually. 5710 and 3800 use "real ideas" and debugging
      - you use testbenches and system-verilog 
    - 2400 is pretty chunked off between the hardware flip flops and the higher level part of the course
      feels like there is a disconnect between the two. Probably better if second half could call back to first half.

  - 5710:
    - muxes, control signals, bits bytes, hexadecimal
    - a little bit of memory (as in C memory model)
    - logic gates not really necessary...

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - encourage them to think they are not in the correct mindest
 - they can learn it, may need a different explanation or need to approach it from a different way
 - would want to sit down with them and help them
 - really like taking the lecture notes and working through the issues
   - if around halfway through semester, probably aroudn the semester
   - do a high level overview and then dive into topics people like
 - transition from asm to C can be pretty hard

 - around the first or second midterm in 1210
   - lots of students come to staff saying they are doomed or cooked
   - reassure them that this will be ok

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - not the most familiar with how the course is structured.
  - couple ideas:
    - like sitting down with students and solving conceptual questions les so frantic debug before hw due
      maybe hosting review sessions
      special drop in session for people struggling with conceptual questoins
    - office hours are less consistent in upper div than lower level. Maybe a committee for more structured office hours
