Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level

  - one of the best skills you can get out of this course is being proficient in C
    - only started C at the end of smester, quick ramp-up
    - more C content scattered throughout
    - feels like class starts in physics land than transfers to a CIS course
   
   - that was the main thing
     - thought about moving from LC4 to something that is real
     - see that it is probably nice since it is used in future

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
  - dealt with this before, TA'd CIS 1600
    - super rigourous rajiv and all of that
    - demoralizing, people think they may want t move away from CIS
    - he didn't start in CIs
    - there is no one picture for what it means to be a CIS major
    - everyone can do this if they do this in the right way
    - less about the efofrt, and how you apply yourself

  - also more serious side
    - if half way through, they failed the exam or sometihng
    - if they think they need to withdraw and retake, then point them towards the appropraite policy (if concern is grade based)

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?


- initiatives?
  - review sessions, really like to be a part of that
    - sort of like "conceptual office hours"? but haven't thought too much about it
    - some flaws in how it is implemented in 1600, not super popular since stuednts focused on hw, may not come unless it was necessary for HW.
  - made him feel better about tha material himself
  - hand written and typeset notes by  TA could be nice
    - slides are really great encyclopedia of info but very long
    - but if you want to get tino meat of it for review purposes, putting together a short ~3 page tpyeset  notes from 70 slidesho would be neat

- 1600
  - did it for 2 sems
  - has a very different staff culture, so much stuff doing week to week
  - every TA does OH & graidng & recitatoin
  - wants to be in a course with a differnt culture
    - intense grading hours, required attendance
  - never found recitaiton that useful, and was a big performance put on every week
    - where things are less tructured/rigid, more flexibility to dive into content
