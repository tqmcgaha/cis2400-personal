Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - felt the course infra was very lacking
    - really difficult to access TA office hours
    - OHQ goes really slowly, it is hard to get help
    - host more OH in-preson
      - may be more efficient
    - assignment instructions have a lot of bugs and inconsistencies
    - comments are also out of date sometimes
    - lots of extra credit opportunities in the class, but it can skew the grades is a concern
  - course content was well structured
    - including what you do in the assignments
    - really liked the programing from the asm to C
  - really into the copmiler stuff

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - I'd say that the course is pretty ambitious. there is a lot of new material. Demystifies a lot of stuff for how the computer works
 - disagree with the student when they say they don't "get it". This isn't the right approach to it
 - at what point did this feeling start?
   - probably had an assignment that went wrong
   - you probably know more than you think
   - encourage them to access office hours

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - had a lot of file output, had a bunch of files to compare with to test on their own
  - have small workshop or introduction to bash scripting in the shell
  - learn how to use the terminal effectively and use their own testing tools
  - work closely with the terminal, make sense to use this
  - he uses vim and tmux
