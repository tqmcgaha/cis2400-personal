Jerry
- took it with me and CJ
- Is a 5710 TA!!!!

Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - 2400 leads to 4710
  - 4710 is now risc-v and is a real thing
  
  - 2400 seems to have less assembly and more C?
    - would like to have more consistency between professors
    - don't mind C or assembly

  - giving more opportunity for bonus on assignments

  - only disagreement with lee is to spend more time on assembly, lee didn't have much hw with it

  - personaly like the boolean logic to prepare for 5710

  - likes thinking about the bridge from 2400 to 3800/5710
    - gates are good to know
      - could possibly use circuitlab or something like that for drawing gates. Possibly important test cases
    - lots of people reuse the linked list from 2400 for 3800

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
  - first question is if drop is still an option
  - start by asking what they are struggling with at a high level or a specific thing
  - usually they have something they understand, but then building on top of it is an issues
  - first figure out what they are struggling with and finindg which subsection they do not understand
  - direct them to lecture notes
    - if lecture notes are not going well, then go through it with them and then
  - does not come up with 3800, but not suprised if it comes up with 2400
  - sort of binary search for where the problem is

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - time permitting, like 3800 he would like to host some recitations like he did in fall. didn't have time this semester
  - also like to attend ta meeting
  - liked exam grading
  - autograder maybe
  
  - what not to do:
    - don't do debates about topics (did some of that in 3500)
  
  - part of it is based on timing

- How was being a 3800 TA? Any particular positives or negatives? Anything that you think could be improved about the TA experience?
  - no merch this semseter :(
  - a bit more disjointed for TA meeting on 4710
    - "just keep the OH and ed under control and we will be fine"
    - annoying when questions did not get much attention on slack
  - having enough TAs to do things is a positive
    - can segment up work some
  - kept losing the 3800 repos
    - maybe try to pin them in slack or something
    - same with notes
  - wish he could have spent more time on it
    - weekly TA meeting was nice to reconnect with people

- One thing that I am planning to change is how TAs are organized. Any thoughts on what I list below? Please be honest about what you think. This may include:
  - Head TAs
  - Trying to build a better "community" among course staff
    - maybe a social TA?
    - May try to have higher expectations on staff meetings
    - May try to have TAs get more involved (recitations, HW dev, Ed committees, etc).

- Is there anything in particular you hope to experience or "get" from TA-ing for CIS 2400?
  - money is nice
  - outside of that, not particularly
  - here for the fun

  - haven't had that many complaints from students for 3800
    - students are pretty grateful
    - help students when I can

- Are there any initiatives you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024? (below are some tentative things. This is not a complete list, I am happy to hear about anything you would be interested in doing!)
  - Lecture Hours
  - Recitations
  - Assignment / Autograder Development
  - Exam Writing
