Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - keep the same:
    - Really liked the examples in the slides were helpful
    - lee would post examples with malloc in the slides
    - homeworks were more complex, but there was a building off poin

  - change
    - ed discussion needs to be better maintained
    - questions would pile up especially if things went un answered
    - sometimes had conflicting answers

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - first teleling them that it is normall to struggle with complex concepts
 - it is not just them
 - they have struggled with the material themselves
 - first, share the places where they think they don't know what is going on and go over them
 - encourage them to break things down into smaller problems
 - encourage them to use ed and come to office hours more

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
