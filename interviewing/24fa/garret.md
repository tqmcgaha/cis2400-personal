Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - no reictations: really enjoy recitation, lecture is where you get the conceptual, reciation gets more practical and hands on
  - homework is where you really learn how to do it.
  - take out recitation -> takes out step in learning the material

  - keep the same: difficulty
    - it is hard, lots of homework
    - really like the difficulty level
    - it is rewarding, you learn the most when challenging and that is what this course 

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
