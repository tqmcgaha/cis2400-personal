Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - reduce first 1/3 of transistors to asm
  - been 2 semesters from 2400, used C and asm but the first 1/3 was least useful
  - Expanded on C
  - maybe more "intro to compilers"
    - since people using it since 1200
    - spend more time on linker
  - 2023 summer
  - encourage them to use command ine stuff
    -may be more of a 3800 thing
  - teaching how to use core files and debugging w/ gdb
  - compiler optimization
    - could be really cool, what do they do
  - brief intro to pipelining and modern processors
  - more eocnnection between assembly and C instead of assembly and transistors
    - why are switch statements so fast? cause of asm jump tables

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - the class is very hard, as with other cis coruses
 - all the programming you've seen before has been in a different paradim
 - it is a big mental shift, C can be very daunting
 - more specifically, what are you struggling with?
   - may point them to office hours & recitations
 - 2400 is a lot of stuff and a lot of work
   - maybe make it 1.5 credits
   - or two parts with mandatory recitations
 - point them towards resources, and talk to mme (instructor)
 - it is ok, especially if you don't have the bandwidth. If it is a lot, you can take it next semester
 - don't think you should give up just cause you don't get it. People don't get it the first time, but do over time once they break into it
 - if it is mental health, could be a different tpoic, point to Travis or someone else not an expert

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - recitations probably?
  - still need to review the material a bit tbh, took it a while ago
  - not sure how far he could go
  - introducing material? lots of stuff that is ipmortant that we don't talk about. Could be talked about in recitation maybe
    - maybe coding problems that help with this
  - have read some books on lower level programming
