Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - may have an understaffed situation, lots of ed questions are going unanswered or a long time to get a response
  - really really long waittime for OH
  - grades are released like a month after they are due
  - lots of domino effects in grading. A problem in part1 is an issue in part 2 etc
    - that grading scheme is not good reflection of mastery

  - think course is well paced
  - likes the knowledge that is covered

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - first, try to tlel them everything is going to be OK
 - went through the same issue in different course
 - if there was a specific topic or is it overall
 - if ifrst case:
   - easier to resolve. Attend professor OH or stay after lecture
 - else:
   - may want to have a 1-on-1 with professor
   - are they using the right resources or blah blah
 - talks about his expereince with math 1310
   - after talking to professor, he decided to drop the course and went to regular and it went better
 - withdrawl is still a valid option
 - fine for a class to be not meant for someone

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - like to be a part of midterm and final reviews
  - went to review session 2 days ago, and it felt unorganized
    - was kind of loose
  - review sesions could be more structured to get through more content
  - spent a whlie asking students which topics to go over, but that wasted time
    - could be more structured and go over more content

Debugging:
- pretyt good debubbing, only found the malloc but explained it well
