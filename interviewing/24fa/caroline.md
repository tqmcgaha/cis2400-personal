Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - super useful would be a recitation
  - maybe call it a "Structured" or "guided" office hours that happens once a week
    - probalby record it so people can attend even if there is a time conflict
  - Queue for office hours was way too long and only a few people would be gotten too
  - this would help go over some concepts and challenging problems to help cement understanding and handle the reptitive questions
  - all office hours were virtual for 2400
    - 1210 office hours were all in-person, and so even if not getting help you can overhear others, it helps build community and was more efficient

  - smaller subset within that
    - encouraging oh to be in-person more
    - providing more structure for TA's for handling some students
      - guidance on not spedning 1 hour on a student
    - mostly reiterating things from above

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - think that the most important thing is that student is being vulnerable and that you should re-affirm that it is ok to feel that.
   2400 is a difficult course. up until the first midterm, was not a fan
  - did not understand how important it was that each concept linked to each other
  - once started coding, it clicked together
  - A: very normal
    B: i do not htink it is indicative that you can "Get it"
       do not really think that thereare those kinds of peopel (at least at penn)
       probably more a function of how they are taking in the mateiral, or something else
  - is there too much stuff, or is something not clicking, or what is the root cause
  - in general, pretty common for students to face something not clicking immediately
    helpful to get into a growth mindset and realize they can put in the effort to get that

  - truly engaging with lecture, asking questions even if felt dumb, it can help a lot
  - reading students reponses on ed

  - probalby check-in with teh student one or two more times a week 

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  - would be happy to get more indepth on how she approaches problems
  - it is important to provide support so they know they are supported
  - but also provide tools so people cna help themselves

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - if the recitation thing were to be implemented, would want to be involved
  - whether it is logitics or helping develop content



Debugging:
- started with asking what issue I face
- compiled and run to see if there were any issues
- noticed seg fault and asked about If I knew gdb, I said a little
- asked to see code and me explain a little, I did
- they read through themselves and I think panicked a little when they didn't know what
  - did find the str++, and null term tho (started to find null term when alarm went off and also found the dynamic stuff)
  - didn't really explain why they were bugs tho (except for null term)
