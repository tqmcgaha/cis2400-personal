Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level

  - consider codio
    - someone was not able to setup the VM and just did everything in notepad and uploaded it
    - may not be the only person to do it

  - farmer and ben lee were extensive
    - felt tedious and over the top

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
  - had a case like this in fall 23
    - always came to OH
    - went over lecture content & hw
    - some debugging tips
    - one day said they would fail etc
    - they are doing a really good job by coming to OH, and it is obvious they are trying hard
    - course is not intuitive or easy in some ways. It is sometimes just hard to handle.
    - don't compare to others
    - mentioned CAPS
    - emphasized that they do a good job and that they may want to talk to Ben about grading stuff (and ben may be better trained to handle this)

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - perhaps recitations
  - figuring out schedule for fall, should be easier
  - knows 2400 material better ahn 3800
  - a deubbing lecture or recitation would be nice
  - most OH things are debugging
    - how to use GDB or valgrind
    - is there a homework (maybe really small) that forces them to use gdb
    - a gradescope mini quiz like the check-ins for 3800?
    - TODO: look into 1210 debugging hw that happened before mazesolver

- How was being a 3800 TA? Any particular positives or negatives? Anything that you think could be improved about the TA experience?
  - honest good and bad
  - staff was nice and better vibes
  - more food for 3800
  - unsatisfying TA-ing
    - not a lot of students in OH
    - enjoyable debugging and helping questions
    - for pennos, had to refer some people to me if adam couldn't help with it
  
  - try organize more TA events or TA-only events

  - make meetings mandatory?

- One thing that I am planning to change is how TAs are organized. Any thoughts on what I list below? Please be honest about what you think. This may include:
  - Head TAs
  - Trying to build a better "community" among course staff
    - maybe a social TA?
    - May try to have higher expectations on staff meetings
    - May try to have TAs get more involved (recitations, HW dev, Ed committees, etc).

- Is there anything in particular you hope to experience or "get" from TA-ing for CIS 2400?
  - like to have good OH again
    - have people discussing lecture content
    - asking for help

- Are there any initiatives you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024? (below are some tentative things. This is not a complete list, I am happy to hear about anything you would be interested in doing!)
  - Lecture Hours
  - Recitations
  - Assignment / Autograder Development
  - Exam Writing
  - Anything you can come up with!
