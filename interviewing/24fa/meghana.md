sophmore, took it this semester

May be sick!!!! So didn't attend in-person :))))))))))))))))

Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  
  - when hw pdf was released, some info would be on ed and it would be inconsistent
    - especially for the homeworks
  - output file had specific file format, but you should be able to see what is going on canvas
    - understand that it is hard,
    - go through the old 900 ed posts and add them back in to make it clear what is needed

  - lack of response on ed-discussion after the coding hw starts
    - still ~100 that are unanswered
    - maybe dedicated response times for TAs
    - a FAQ document

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
 - definitely something that you can understand, content builds up quickly and it is easy to fall behind
 - ak their knowledge and efofr they have put in
 - can share teh struggles they have
 - be careful not to say
   - "it is easy just do this"
 - be mindful of what difficulties they have and be empathetic so they feel supported and then you can dig into whatever issues they have
 - assure they can come back and that yo uare dependable


- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - two things:
    - ed posts & HW specs?
  - particpation things done near the end
    - Farmer started implementing EC or late hours if you attended class
    - only in second half of class.
    - maybe do something like this in the beginning
  - possibly helping with website
