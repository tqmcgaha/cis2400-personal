Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - add bak in optional recitations
  - have two midterms (3 exams total) instead of one to space out content. Currently there is just 1
  - beneficial to have 1 hw focused and 1 more software focused course
  - lack of clarifications for hws, lots of points that were not specific.
    - lot of issues with testing and stuff
  - hear more on memory
    - like sram dram stuff 
    - possibly more in the physics of the memory
  - maybe some small introduction to microcontrollers
    - maybe a little intro so you can see if you want to take another course on it

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
  - Start by assessing their approach the the course. Are they attending lecture consistently and taking notes, attendind recitation etc. if they see the videos themslves
  - try and help them with study habits
  - if putting in effort and struggling, then try and investigate how they approach the homework
  - see if it is someething required and if it is, try and motivate them.

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - give people opportunity to learn more about the physics
  - some extra out of class time to learn physics
  - maybe have a more hardware oriented project in beginning of the course, use IC's to design something bigger
    - had something as extra credit
    - cool to have something bigger or extra credit.
