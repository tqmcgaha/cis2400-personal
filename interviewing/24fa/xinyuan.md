Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level


  - shin -yuen (yoo en)
  - took 2400 with me and ta'd the last two semester

  - we used Codio for the programming assignments
    - lets you see the studen'ts code and pull it up more easily
    - the VM works a lot better since codio sometimes doesn't cooperate
    - go back to the VM

  - liked when Dr lee taught about things like caches and cache coherence. 4710 also covers that
  - liked how the course was more of a thing with intro to assembly and C. The cache coherence stuff is cool, but they learn it again later and also hard for it to relate to the rest of the class material
  
  - when she took the class, allowed to collaborate with one person, and it helped her. Last two projects you could collaborate with another person and that was very helpful. Tom Farmer doesn't do that.
    - could hlep, and helps learn how to communicate
    - I didn't do this ???

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
  -  definitely validate their feelings and share their own expereince with doing 2400. Completely new concepts for intro to systems
  - a lot of people share the same feelings that they are going to
  - what concepts do they feel they are not really grapping with.
  - help come up with a study plan

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - re-designing the homeworks.
  - being able to design the homeworks while keeping the hw in mind
    - lots of questions about ambigious wording on HW design
