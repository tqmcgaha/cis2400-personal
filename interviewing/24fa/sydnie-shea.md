MSE coming in fall
took it at UBC (61c)
- mostly coding in C, assembly, and some logic gates
- was cs mentoring at berkely, 5 sutdents they did a class with every week
  - mentored some new TAs
  - tutor in hs in the past

- Dan garcia
  - good taking a course with him
  - found the course to be interesting

Questions:
- Imagine you are given the power to make any changes to the course, what do you change? What do you keep the same about it?
  - If you haven't taken the course, you can scan the website from the last time I taught the course: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/22fa/ or you can describe an imaginary course at a high level
  - mostly liked how the course was laid out
  - especially the emphais on the learning instead of stressing on grades
  - sometimes it is useful to have projects instead of homework assignments
    - projects tend to be longer and be multiple weeks
    - usually a bit higher level since more material
    - allows you to go more in depth on some topics
    - doesn't remember homeworks but did remember projects
  - drew a good connection between hardware and software

- Let's say a student comes to your office hours around half way through the semester and says they think they don't have what it takes to understand the material. That they have tried, but do not think they are the kind of person to "get it". What do you do?
  - doesn't subscribe to the idea that ssomeone can or can't get it
  - some things work better or worse for some students
  - would want to work out why they can't or can get it, see if there is a new approach to something
  - important to remember that whlie the course is ipmortant, it is only a part of copmuter science
    - this serves only as a foundation
    - sometimes youll get it better after taking a future course (new context, or approach)

- A student comes to OH and asks for advice on how to approach problems in the course, what advice do you give?
  -

- Are there any initiatives/changes you would like to lead or be a part of in Fall 2024?
  - definitely want to be able to help students and be an approchable person to people learning CS
  - making sure that you are someone approachable
